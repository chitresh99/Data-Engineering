What is Big Data ?

Big data refers to the extremely large datasets that are too complex or vast for traditional data processing.This data is generated from a variety of sources like social media, sensors, transaction records, mobile devices, and more. Big data has three main characteristics, often called the "3 Vs”

- **Volume**: The sheer size of the data. Big data involves vast amounts of information, often in petabytes or exabytes.
- **Velocity**: The speed at which this data is generated, collected, and processed. For example, social media platforms and IoT devices produce a constant stream of data.
- **Variety**: The diverse types of data. Big data includes structured data (like databases), unstructured data (like text, images, videos), and semi-structured data (like JSON or XML files).

Big data technologies (such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases) allow us to store, process, and analyze these large and varied datasets to uncover insights, patterns, and trends that can help in decision-making, optimizing processes, or even creating new products and services.
